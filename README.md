ScalableLayout for Android. 
====================

Class: com.jnm.android.widget.ScalableLayout 

Just one code for every resolution of Android devices!<br/>
====================

ScalableLayout is one of the way to show consistent UI<br/>
for every different resolution of Android devices including tablets.<br/>
<br/>
ScalableLayout can be usable in replace of Layouts for example FrameLayout or LinearLayout,<br/>
which are used to place widgets from Android platform.<br/>
<br/>
Widgets to make application UI like TextView or Imageview<br/>
would get relative (x,y) coordinates and relative (width, height) values in ScalableLayout.<br/>
And then the ScalableLayout would place and resize the widgets inside according to its size.<br/>
<br/>
You can use ScalableLayout by just one java file importing.<br/>
You can use both of Java and XML to place ScalableLayout in your project.<br/>
<br/>
ScalableLayout is used on the everysing application which was awarded as GooglePlay App Awards 2013.<br/>
<br/>
